## About

[Spell It](https://play-spell-it.vercel.app/) is a simple spelling application that utilizes Text-To-Speech (TTS) functionality to pronounce words for users to spell. It specifically makes use of the [`react-speech-kit`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-speech-kit) library which serves as a wrapper around the Web Speech API.

## API Used

The app currently uses [Random word API](http://random-word-api.herokuapp.com/home) to generate words. However, please note that the API occasionally generates unusual words. In future development, alternative APIs or word sources may be explored to ensure a more consistent and appropriate word selection.
